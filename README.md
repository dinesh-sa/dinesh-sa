# Welcome :)
Hi!! I'm Dinesh, currently a graduate student at the University of Southern California, pursuing the Master of Science program in Computer Science (Fall 2022).
Till date, I've worked at Walmart Global Tech (India) and the Indian Space and Research Organization (ISRO), to build scalable solutions to 
problems ranging from the shortest-distance-path problem at Walmart to Land Use-Land Cover classification at ISRO.

ðŸ‘€ My interests in Computer Science include (not limited to) :
- Competitive coding (Java / Python)
- Spring, Microservice Architecture, Scalability, Fault Tolerance, OOD, Database indexes and optimizations, CI/CD
- Machine Learning concepts and implementation using Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras

<br/>
My GitHub contains projects I'd worked on during my Undergrad days, and solutions to LeetCode problems that I practice on a daily basis.
